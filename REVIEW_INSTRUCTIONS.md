summary = "The PR successfully specializes the `CLAUDE.md` file for the `agent-readiness-audit` CLI tool, removing generic boilerplate and accurately documenting the Python ecosystem, workflows, and coding standards used. This will significantly improve AI assistance for this specific project."

title = "Context Discrepancy: Node.js vs Python"
description = "The provided project context lists 'Language: Node.js/TypeScript', but the updated `CLAUDE.md` and commit messages describe a Python project (Typer, Pydantic, uv). Assuming the repository is indeed the Python CLI tool described, this change is correct and the prompt context was inaccurate. However, if this is a Node.js repository, applying Python context instructions will confuse the AI agent."
suggestion = "Verify that the repository is indeed the Python-based `agent-readiness-audit` tool. If so, the changes are valid."
