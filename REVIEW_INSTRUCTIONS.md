# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The removal of the deprecated agent-reminder workflow is approved. However, the changes to the CI pipeline introduce unpinned dependencies for Python linting, which can lead to non-deterministic build failures.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/ci.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Unpinned dependency 'ruff'",
      "description": "The command `pip install ruff` installs the latest version of the linter. Ruff frequently updates to add new rules or change behavior. Without a pinned version, the CI pipeline may break unexpectedly on future runs even without code changes.",
      "suggestion": "Pin the version of ruff to ensure deterministic CI builds. Example: `pip install ruff==0.1.14`."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": ".github/workflows/ci.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Redundant linting tools",
      "description": "The workflow appears to maintain `flake8` execution while adding `ruff`. Ruff is generally capable of replacing Flake8 entirely and is significantly faster.",
      "suggestion": "Verify if `flake8` is still necessary. If Ruff is configured to cover the required rules, remove the `flake8` step to optimize CI runtime."
