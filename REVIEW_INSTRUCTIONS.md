# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR fixes whitespace issues in Telegram configuration and upgrades the Python linter. However, the method used to strip whitespace is unsafe for missing environment variables, which could crash the workflow in contexts where secrets are unavailable (e.g., forks). The linter upgrade also represents a major version jump requiring verification.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/gemini-pr-review-plus.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Potential workflow crash on missing secrets",
      "description": "Chaining `.strip()` directly to `os.environ.get(...)` will raise an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` if the environment variable is not set. This commonly happens in PRs from forks where secrets are restricted, causing the workflow to fail hard instead of handling the missing configuration gracefully.",
      "suggestion": "Use a safer default to handle missing variables: `os.getenv(\"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\", \"\").strip()`."
    },

      "title": "Significant Ruff version jump",
      "description": "Upgrading `ruff` from 0.1.14 to 0.8.6 is a massive version leap. Ruff frequently introduces new rules or changes configuration schemas in minor versions. This increases the risk of the CI pipeline failing due to new linting violations.",
      "suggestion": "Verify that `ruff` passes locally with version 0.8.6 before merging to prevent blocking the CI pipeline."
