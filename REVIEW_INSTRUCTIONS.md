# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

[review]
summary = "This is a significant and well-structured update implementing the V2 maturity model. The pillar and gate logic is sound. However, there are implementation flaws in the new checks: the secret scanning regex for OpenAI is outdated/too specific, and the configuration checks (mypy, linter) rely on brittle string matching that will fail on valid configurations (e.g. missing spaces). These should be addressed to avoid false negatives/positives."

title = "Outdated OpenAI API Key Regex"
description = "The regex `(sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48})` strictly matches 48-character keys starting with `sk-`. Modern OpenAI project keys (`sk-proj-...`) and service account keys are significantly longer and have different structures. This check will fail to detect valid modern keys, providing a false sense of security."
suggestion = "Update the regex to be more permissive regarding length and prefixes, e.g., `r'(sk-[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]{30,})'`, or consult current pattern recommendations."

title = "Brittle String Matching for Mypy Config"
description = "The check `check_mypy_strictness` searches for the exact string `\"strict = true\"` or `\"disallow_untyped_defs = true\"`. TOML and INI files are whitespace-flexible; a configuration line like `strict=true` (without spaces) is valid but will cause this check to fail (false negative)."
suggestion = "Use a regex that handles variable whitespace (e.g., `r'strict\\s*=\\s*true'`) or parse the TOML/INI content properly if possible."

title = "Coverage Check Relies on Artifacts vs Configuration"
description = "`check_machine_readable_coverage` checks for the existence of `coverage.xml` or `coverage.json`. These are generated artifacts that may not exist in a fresh clone or CI environment before tests run. A static analysis tool should ideally check the *configuration* (e.g., `pyproject.toml` or `.coveragerc`) to verify that coverage reporting is enabled, rather than the existence of the report file itself."
suggestion = "Modify the check to look for coverage configuration (e.g., `[tool.coverage.report]`) or clearly document that tests must be run prior to the audit."
