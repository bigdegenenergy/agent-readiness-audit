# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR implements the v3 specification with comprehensive domain checks and scoring. However, there are artifacts from previous reviews included, and several heuristic checks are brittle (regex/string parsing) or lack robustness (missing dependencies).",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md",
      "line": 1,
      "title": "Accidental file commit",
      "description": "This file appears to be a log or output from a previous review process and should not be committed to the repository.",
      "suggestion": "Remove the file."

      "line": 108,
      "title": "Brittle function signature parsing",
      "description": "The check `check_return_types_documented` iterates line-by-line looking for `def` and `->` on the same line. This fails for multiline function definitions (common with black/ruff formatting) where `->` is on a subsequent line, causing false negatives.",
      "suggestion": "Use Python's built-in `ast` module to parse the code and check `FunctionDef.returns` is not None. This is robust and handles all formatting styles."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "agent_readiness_audit/checks/security_advanced.py",
      "line": 130,
      "title": "Silent failure on missing git dependency",
      "description": "`is_file_tracked_by_git` catches all exceptions. If `git` is not installed in the environment (common in minimal CI containers), `subprocess.run` raises `FileNotFoundError` (wrapped in Exception), which returns `False`. This causes `check_no_sensitive_files_committed` to pass (false negative) because it assumes the file is untracked.",
      "suggestion": "Check for git availability once at module level. If git is missing, either skip the check with a warning or fail open (assume tracked if uncertain) to prevent security oversights."
    },

      "line": 135,
      "title": "Case sensitivity in Dict check",
      "description": "`check_no_implicit_dict_schemas` looks for `Dict[str, Any]` but may miss `dict[str, Any]` (standard in Python 3.9+) due to case-sensitive string matching.",
      "suggestion": "Add `dict[...]` patterns or normalize case when checking (while ensuring not to match irrelevant text)."
