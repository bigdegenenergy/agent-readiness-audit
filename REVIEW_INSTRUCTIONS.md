# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```toml
[review]
summary = "This is a substantial and well-structured update that effectively evolves the audit tool to v2. The new pillar/gate architecture and checks (Agentic Security, Documentation) are robust. However, the introduction of `tomllib` creates a hard dependency on Python 3.11+ which may break compatibility for users on older environments (3.9/3.10). Additionally, the file reading utility may suppress legitimate errors too aggressively."

title = "Python version compatibility risk with `tomllib`"
description = "The module imports `tomllib`, which was added to the standard library in Python 3.11. If this tool is intended to run in environments with Python 3.10 or older (common in CI/CD or user local machines), this import will cause an `ImportError`. No `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` changes were included to indicate a dependency update (like adding `tomli` backport)."
suggestion = "Use a compatibility import: `try: import tomllib; except ImportError: import tomli as tomllib`. Ensure `tomli` is added to project dependencies if supporting < 3.11."

file = "agent_readiness_audit/checks/base.py"
line = 0
title = "Silent failure in `read_file_safe`"
description = "The `read_file_safe` utility catches all `Exception` types (or `IOError` per summaries) and returns `None`. While this prevents crashes, it masks permission errors or transient FS issues. For an audit tool, distinguishing between 'file not found' and 'file unreadable' is important. If a critical config file exists but is unreadable, the audit might incorrectly report a failure (or success) on configuration checks."
suggestion = "Log a warning to stderr or a collected log buffer when a file exists but cannot be read. Consider returning a specific error sentinel or raising a custom `AuditError` for permission issues instead of silent `None`."

file = "agent_readiness_audit/checks/agentic_security.py"
line = 0
title = "Prompt scanning scope may be too narrow"
description = "The `check_prompt_secret_scanning` logic recursively searches for directories named `prompts` or `templates`. This heuristic will miss prompts defined as string constants in other source files (e.g., `src/agent.py`) or in documentation files outside those specific directories. This might give a false sense of security."
suggestion = "Clarify the scope in the check description or output. Consider renaming the check to `check_prompt_directory_secrets` to be precise, or expand the scan to all code files (with appropriate ignore lists) if performance permits."
