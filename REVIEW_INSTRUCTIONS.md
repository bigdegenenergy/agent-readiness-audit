[review]
summary = "This PR successfully implements the v2 Agent Maturity Model, introducing a robust system of Pillars and Gates. The new check modules are well-structured, and the updates to the scanner logic correctly integrate the new scoring dimensions. The documentation updates clearly communicate the new maturity levels. I have noted a potential dependency issue for Python 3.10 support and a suggestion regarding file scanning performance."
decision = "APPROVE"

title = "Missing `tomli` dependency verification"
description = "The code implements a fallback to `tomli` for Python < 3.11 to parse `pyproject.toml`. However, the PR does not show changes to dependency files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`). If `tomli` is not explicitly added as a dependency for older Python versions, `check_mypy_strictness` will silently skip parsing `pyproject.toml` on Python 3.10, leading to incorrect audit results."
suggestion = "Verify that `tomli` is added to the project dependencies with a marker like `python_version < '3.11'`."

title = "Performance: recursive scan exclusions"
description = "The new `check_prompt_secret_scanning` performs a recursive file search. It is critical to ensure that `os.walk` explicitly excludes heavy directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, `venv`) to avoid performance bottlenecks and analyzing irrelevant files."
suggestion = "Ensure the directory traversal logic includes an exclusion list (e.g., `dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in IGNORED_DIRS]`)."

title = "Significant reduction in test score thresholds"
description = "The `test_scan_agent_ready_repo` threshold was lowered from 12 to 9. While the v2 model introduces new scoring dynamics, a drop of 25% in the required score for a 'ready' repo is significant. Ensure this aligns with the intended strictness of the audit."
suggestion = "Double-check that the threshold of 9 is not too permissive for a repository considered 'Agent Ready'."
