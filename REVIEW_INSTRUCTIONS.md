# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR modernizes the Python codebase by adopting Python 3.10+ syntax and simplifying logic. However, this introduces a hard dependency on Python 3.10+ which may break compatibility if the environment is older. Additionally, the refactoring of security validators and removal of CI steps carries risk that requires verification.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "agent_readiness_audit/checks/documentation.py",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Python 3.10+ Requirement Introduced",
      "description": "The use of the bitwise OR operator `|` for type unions in `isinstance` checks (e.g., `isinstance(node, A | B)`) is only supported in Python 3.10 and later. If this tool is intended to run in environments with Python 3.8 or 3.9 (common in CI/CD pipelines or developer machines), this change will cause runtime errors.",
      "suggestion": "Confirm that the project's minimum supported Python version is 3.10+. If support for older versions is needed, revert to using tuples for `isinstance` (e.g., `isinstance(node, (A, B))`) and `Union` or `Optional` for type hints."

      "title": "Verify Logic Negation in is_safe_command Refactor",
      "description": "The refactor of `is_safe_command` to use `any()` must correctly negate the result. If the logic was changed from `if pattern in cmd: return False` to `return any(...)`, it would return `True` when a forbidden pattern IS found, effectively allowing unsafe commands. It must be `return not any(...)`.",
      "suggestion": "Double-check the refactored logic in `is_safe_command`. Ensure it returns `False` if any unsafe pattern is found (i.e., `return not any(pattern in cmd for pattern in unsafe_patterns)`)."

      "title": "Potential Loss of Linting for Dot-Directories",
      "description": "The PR removes the explicit `ruff check .claude/hooks` step, relying on `ruff check .` (if it exists in the remaining 'lint' job). Standard tools often ignore hidden directories (starting with `.`) by default unless explicitly configured. Removing the specific step may result in hooks going unlinted.",
      "suggestion": "Verify that the remaining lint configuration explicitly includes the `.claude` directory, or restore the specific lint step for hooks to ensure they are checked."

      "file": ".claude/hooks/validators.py",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Python Version Compatibility for Type Hints",
      "description": "The use of `list[...]` and `dict[...]` as generic type hints requires Python 3.9+. While less restrictive than the 3.10+ requirement for `isinstance`, it further restricts the minimum supported version.",
      "suggestion": "Ensure the `requires-python` metadata in `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` matches these new version constraints (>=3.10 due to Issue #1)."
