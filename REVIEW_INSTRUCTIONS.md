[review]
summary = "The PR successfully introduces standard development tooling (Makefile with uv/ruff/mypy) and improves test hygiene with timeouts. Removing the misleading PyPI badge is also a good correctness fix. Note: The project context describes this as a Node.js/TypeScript repo, but these changes are exclusively for a Python environment."
decision = "APPROVE"

title = "Distinguish between formatting (write) and checking format (read-only)"
description = "The `check` target currently runs `format` (`ruff format .`), which modifies files in place. While excellent for local development, this behavior can obscure unformatted code in CI pipelines (which might pass silently despite formatting changes). CI typically requires `ruff format --check`."
suggestion = "Consider adding a `format-check` target (`uv run ruff format --check .`) for CI usage, or simply ensure your CI pipeline checks for a dirty git working directory after running `make check`."

title = "Verify test suite against new global timeout"
description = "A global 60-second timeout is a good safety mechanism. However, if there are existing integration tests that legitimately take longer, they will now fail."
suggestion = "Ensure existing slow tests are marked explicitly with `@pytest.mark.timeout(N)` if they exceed the new global default."
