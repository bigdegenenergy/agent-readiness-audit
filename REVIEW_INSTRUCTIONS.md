{
  "review": {
    "summary": "This PR implements the ARA v3 specification with domain-based scoring and significantly expands the check coverage. While the architecture and majority of new checks look solid, there are a few implementation issues. Most notably, a compatibility regression with Python <3.10 syntax, a logic flaw that penalizes standard CI workflows, and potentially outdated security regexes.",

      "title": "Python Version Incompatibility",
      "description": "The use of the bitwise OR operator `|` for union types in `isinstance` (`ast.FunctionDef | ast.AsyncFunctionDef`) was introduced in Python 3.10. This will cause a `TypeError` on Python 3.8 and 3.9, which are likely still supported environments for this tool.",
      "suggestion": "Revert to using a tuple: `isinstance(node, (ast.FunctionDef, ast.AsyncFunctionDef))`."
    },

      "line": 95,
      "title": "False Positive on CI Workflows",
      "description": "The `check_no_hidden_critical_logic` check includes `.github/workflows/*.yml` in its `hidden_patterns`. The check logic fails if *any* file matching these patterns is found. This means any repository with standard GitHub Actions workflows will fail this audit check, which is incorrect behavior as CI configuration is expected in that location.",
      "suggestion": "Remove `.github/workflows/*.yml` from `hidden_patterns`. If the intent is to find excessive logic in YAML files, the check needs to analyze file size or content, not just existence."

      "title": "Outdated OpenAI Key Regex",
      "description": "The regex `sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}` matches legacy OpenAI keys but will miss newer 'project' keys (which start with `sk-proj-` and are longer) and other new formats.",
      "suggestion": "Update the OpenAI key regex to support newer formats. For example: `r'sk-(proj-)?[a-zA-Z0-9-]{40,}'`."
