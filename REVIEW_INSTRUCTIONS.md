# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```toml
[review]
summary = "The PR introduces a sophisticated agentic workflow but contains critical flaws that need addressing before merge. Specifically, the security scanning workflow suppresses all failure exit codes, rendering it useless. The pre-commit PII hook uses a regex so broad it will block standard commit messages. Finally, the configuration relies on a non-existent future model ID which will cause API errors."
decision = "REQUEST_CHANGES"

severity = "critical"
file = ".github/workflows/security.yml"
line = 0
title = "Security scans are effectively disabled"
description = "The steps for ShellCheck and Bandit append `|| true` to their execution commands (e.g., `exec bandit ... || true`). This swallows the exit code, causing the CI job to pass even if critical vulnerabilities are detected. These scans should fail the build to serve as an actual gate."
suggestion = "Remove `|| true` from the security scanning steps to ensure the workflow fails when issues are found."

[[issues]]
severity = "critical"
file = ".claude/hooks/pre-commit.sh"
line = 0
title = "PII Regex is too aggressive and will block valid commits"
description = "The PII scanning logic includes a regex for names: `[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+`. This pattern matches standard English phrases, Title Case sentences, and commit summaries (e.g., 'Fix Bug', 'Update Readme'). Since the hook blocks commits upon detection, this will prevent developers from making standard commits."
suggestion = "Remove or significantly refine the name detection regex. Heuristic name detection is generally too noisy for a blocking pre-commit hook."

[[issues]]
severity = "important"
file = ".claude/settings.json"
line = 0
title = "Configuration uses non-existent/future model ID"
description = "Multiple configuration files (settings.json, agents/*.md) specify `model = \"claude-opus-4-5-20251101\"`. This appears to be a speculative or future model identifier. Using a non-existent model ID will likely result in immediate `400 Bad Request` errors from the Anthropic API, rendering the agents unusable."
suggestion = "Change the model identifier to a currently available version (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` or `claude-3-opus-20240229`)."

[[issues]]
severity = "important"
file = ".claude/hooks/auto-approve.sh"
line = 0
title = "Auto-approval allows indirect code execution"
description = "The script auto-approves `npm test`. However, the agent also has the `Edit` tool permission. A malicious or hallucinating agent could edit `package.json` to insert arbitrary commands into the `test` script, then trigger `npm test` to execute them without human oversight. This bypasses the safety net."
suggestion = "Disable auto-approval for script runners like `npm test` if `package.json` (or equivalent config) has been modified in the current session, or remove script runners from the auto-approve allowlist entirely."
